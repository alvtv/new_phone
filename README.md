# Modified GCPhone, known as Crew Phone but this time featuring MumbleVoIP and TokoVoIP

# Information

- This was modified by Alv#9999 and re-obfuscated for the original creators privacy.
- I have featured a v1.1 and v1.2 SQL, since you had to do the work yourself with the original SQL.

# Installation

- Clone this repository
- Install all 4 resources into your [esx] directory
- Import whicever SQL fits your ESX Framework
- Add the following lines to your `server.cfg`
    "start gcphone"
    "start esx_addons_gcphone"
    "start xsound"
    "start screenshot-basic"

- You must have this version of screenshot-basic, otherwise there is a chance that the camera that is built into the phone will not work.

# Credits

- Original Creator of the CrewPhone
- Frazzle for creating MumbleVoIP
- Itokoyamato for creating TokoVoIP
